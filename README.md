# PMM-Images
Repo to store collection images for Plex Meta Manager. Collection template by [ishalioh](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlexPosters/comments/falwmu/genre_poster_template/).

## anime-studios
Collection of posters for different anime studios designed to work with the mal_studio option. Logos are imported from SVG vector files. Most background colours have been taken from the original logo, unless the logo was only one colour.

## anime-genres
TBA. Inspired by [jjjonesjr33](https://theposterdb.com/user/jjjonesjr33), a more complete set of genre posters for use with the mal_genre option. I liked the template (same as above) and border, but wanted some different backgrounds and some of the newer MAL themes.

Note: I don't own any of the artwork used in the posters - it was all found on Google. If you are the copyright owner and/or would like to request credit, please contact me and I'll add credit or remove the image as necessary.

## config
TBA. A copy of my YAML files for different movie and anime collections.

## Requests/Contributions
If I've missed a logo/genre you particularly would like, please open an issue. Please note, opening an issue is not a guarantee it will be worked on/added.
